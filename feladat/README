Stage simulator
(The Eras Tour stage - Taylor Swift)

My program is based on Taylor Swift's Eras Tour stage from her recent 
tour. The main objects are the stage, the screen, and the movable 
platforms. Their textures can be changed to different visuals of the 
concert, which represent each album of hers.

There's a control panel on the left side of the window, which contains 
three buttons. The first button changes the texture, with the second 
button the screen-, stage-, and platformlight can be switched on and 
off. The third button is divided to four parts, red, green, blue, and 
black. Clicking on each button will add more of the color to the 
spotlight on the top of the screen (the black will turn off the lights).

There's a little map on the top of the right side, which tracks the 
camera's location.

'Help' cantains further instructions (F1).
